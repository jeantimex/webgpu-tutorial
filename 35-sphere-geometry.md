# 35. Sphere Geometry

This tutorial now uses the same wireframe pipeline and GUI controls as **47. Wireframe**, but focused on a single procedural sphere. You can switch between:

- **Line-list wireframe** for crisp edges
- **Barycentric wireframe** for smooth, anti-aliased edges

The GUI includes the same settings as the wireframe sample (toggle wireframe mode, animate, depth bias, thickness, and alpha threshold) so you can compare both techniques on a single model.
