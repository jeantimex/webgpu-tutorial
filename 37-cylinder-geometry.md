# 37. Cylinder Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural cylinder. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The cylinder geometry supports configurable radius, height, segment counts, and partial arcs so you can explore the impact on both lit surfaces and wireframe edges.
