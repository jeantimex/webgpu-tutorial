# 38. Procedural Torus Geometry

A **Torus** is essentially a donut shape. It is generated by taking a circle (the tube) and sweeping it along another circular path (the main radius).

## 1. Parameters

*   **`radius`**: The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube.
*   **`tube`**: The radius of the tube itself.
*   **`radialSegments`**: How round the tube is (cross-section).
*   **`tubularSegments`**: How round the main ring is.
*   **`arc`**: The central angle. $2 \times \text{PI}$ creates a full donut; less creates a horseshoe.

## 2. Implementation

The math involves two angles, $u$ and $v$:
1.  **$u$ (0 to arc)**: Moves along the main ring.
2.  **$v$ (0 to 2*PI)**: Moves around the tube cross-section.

```typescript
x = (radius + tube * cos(v)) * cos(u)
y = (radius + tube * cos(v)) * sin(u)
z = tube * sin(v)
```
