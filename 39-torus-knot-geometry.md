# 39. Torus Knot Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural torus knot. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The knot geometry supports configurable radius, tube size, segment counts, and the `p/q` winding parameters to explore how topology affects both lit surfaces and wireframe edges.
