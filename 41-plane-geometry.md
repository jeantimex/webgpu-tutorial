# 41. Plane Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural plane. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The plane geometry supports configurable size and subdivisions so you can see how grid density affects both the lit surface and wireframe overlay.
