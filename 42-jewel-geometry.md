# 42. Jewel Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single faceted jewel. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The jewel geometry supports configurable radius and segment counts so you can explore how faceting changes both the lit surface and wireframe edges.
