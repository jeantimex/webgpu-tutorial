# 45. Rock Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural rock. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The rock geometry supports configurable radius, segment counts, and a randomness factor to explore how noise affects both the lit surface and wireframe edges.
