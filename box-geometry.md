# Box Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural box. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The box geometry supports configurable size and segment counts so you can see how subdivisions affect both the lit surface and the wireframe overlay.
