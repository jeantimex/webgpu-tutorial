# Cone Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural cone. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The cone geometry supports configurable radius, height, segment counts, and partial arcs so you can explore how topology affects both the lit surface and wireframe edges.
