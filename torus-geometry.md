# Torus Geometry

This tutorial now mirrors the **47. Wireframe** pipeline and GUI controls, but focuses on a single procedural torus. You can switch between line-list and barycentric wireframe rendering, adjust depth bias, and animate the model.

The torus geometry supports configurable radius, tube size, segment counts, and arc length so you can explore how subdivisions affect both the lit surface and wireframe edges.
